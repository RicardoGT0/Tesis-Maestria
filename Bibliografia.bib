abstract = {Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can be regarded as a special kind of Business Process Management (BPM) that relies on GUI automation adaptors instead of regular interfaces for intersystem communication. Another difference between RPA and standard BPM is that RPA processes do not need to be defined from scratch as RPA is basically transforming an operator's implicit process knowledge into a workflow definition to be executed by the robot's workflow engine. In this context, the basic idea of Test Driven Development (TDD) can be used to jump start requirements engineering and process definition by leveraging the operator's interaction with the workflow targeted for automation. This paper presents a conceptual approach for integrating TDD with RPA development: In a first step, the manual process is enriched with probes that record input and output values for each execution of the workflow. Users then manually perform the process using screen recording and the probes to define annotated test cases stored in a backlog. TDD works by selecting an arbitrary recording from the backlog and using it for automating the equivalence class of test cases to which it belongs. All test cases from this equivalence class are then removed from the backlog. These two steps are iteratively repeated until all test cases are covered by the robot process definition.},

abstract = {The continuous digitization requires organizations to improve the automation of their business processes. Among others, this has lead to an increased interest in Robotic Process Automation (RPA). RPA solutions emerge in the form of software that automatically executes repetitive and routine tasks. While the benefits of RPA on cost savings and other relevant performance indicators have been demonstrated in different contexts, one of the key challenges for RPA endeavors is to effectively identify processes and tasks that are suitable for automation. Textual process descriptions, such as work instructions, provide rich and important insights about this matter. However, organizations often maintain hundreds or even thousands of them, which makes a manual analysis unfeasible for larger organizations. Recognizing the large manual effort required to determine the current degree of automation in an organization's business processes, we use this paper to propose an approach that is able to automatically do so. More specifically, we leverage supervised machine learning to automatically identify whether a task described in a textual process description is manual, an interaction of a human with an information system or automated. An evaluation with a set of 424 activities from a total of 47 textual process descriptions demonstrates that our approach produces satisfactory results.},

@article{QIAO2018336,
abstract = {A graph is one of important mathematical tools to describe ubiquitous relations. In the classical graph theory and some applications, graphs are generally provided in advance, or can at least be defined clearly. Thus, the main focus is to measure/analyze the graphs for mining informative patterns. However, for many real-world scenarios, the graph is often uncertain due to the fact that data associated with the vertices in the graph are high-dimensional, noisy, differently distributed, and even no clear definition. As a result, one needs to design or learn graphs from data prior to any analysis, which in turn affects the subsequent tasks. Therefore, constructing a high-quality graph has become an increasingly hot research problem, which inspired many graph construction methods being proposed in the past years. Since there has been no systematic summary on this topic, in this paper, we review the main-stream graph construction/learning methods involved in both general machine learning algorithms (including semi-supervised learning, clustering, manifold learning, and spectral kernel learning, etc.) and some specific applications (especially, the modeling and analysis of functional brain connectivity). Additionally, we introduce a matrix-regularized graph learning framework that can benefit to unify some existing graph construction models and develop new graph learning algorithms. Finally, we discuss several related topics and some promising research directions in this field.},

abstract = {A key challenge in designing humanoid robots is producing natural and human-like behaviour. This study addressed this challenge by developing an instructive interface to design natural and human-like behaviour in a humanoid robot that will be helpful not only for professional robot motion designers but also for nonprofessionals. A staging method called contemporary colloquial theatre theory has been developed in the field of theatre to reproduce the natural behaviour of humans. Based on the theory, to design robot behaviour, we extracted implicit knowledge from a director's instructions given to a robot actor in a robot theatre project, where the robot functions as an actor and interacts with human actors. This paper shows the validity of applying this knowledge extraction method by means of a public stage play entitled Night On The Milky Way Train and two short plays created for the purpose of carrying out an analysis. Our analysis produced important rules for designing the behaviour of humanoid robots. The rules were extracted in forms suited to the instructive function of the interface. In this paper, we report the results of a subjective experiment conducted to verify the effectiveness of this function. Our experimental results suggest that the rules derived are effective in improving robot behaviour.},

@article{Senft2016,
abstract = {When a robot is learning it needs to explore its environment and how its environment responds on its actions. When the environment is large and there are a large number of possible actions the robot can take, this exploration phase can take prohibitively long. However, exploration can often be optimised by letting a human expert guide the robot during its learning. Interactive machine learning, in which a human user interactively guides the robot as it learns, has been shown to be an effective way to teach a robot. It requires an intuitive control mechanism to allow the human expert to provide feedback on the robot's progress. This paper presents a novel method which combines Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Progressively Autonomous Robot Competencies (SPARC). By allowing the user to fully control the robot and by treating rewards as implicit, SPARC aims to learn an action policy while maintaining human supervisory oversight of the robot's behaviour. This method is evaluated and compared to Interactive Reinforcement Learning in a robot teaching task. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate that SPARC allows for safer and faster learning by the robot, whilst not placing a high workload on the human teacher.},

abstract = {Skilled human welder adjusts welding parameters including the welding torch attitude, moving speed and position to control weld quality and avoid weld defects based on real time observed varying weld pool surface for precision joining using gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). However, welder behavior/adjustment appears to be a complex reactive response. To understand this complex response and develop intelligent robotic arc welding, a new scheme that correlated welding torch attitude to weld pool surface to study welder behavior in torch adjustment as response to weld pool was proposed and realized. The torch attitude and the 3D weld pool surface were synchronously measured using a wire inertial measuring unit (IMU) and a laser vision-based approach. An image processing algorithm was developed to extract the characteristic parameters of the weld pool surface from the laser stripes reflected by the specular pool surface. The improved quaternion-based unscented Kalman filter was used to estimate the torch orientation from its inertial measurement data, showing that the torch attitude has been obtained with an acceptable error in the order of 1??(x axis and y axis) and 2??(z axis). Several experiments were performed and the correlation of the corresponding data was detailed. It indicates that the change of torch attitude represents the welder's operating skills, welding experience and smart decision. The three characteristic parameters reflect the welder's reactive response on the torch adjustments. The curvature radius of laser stripes can predict the changing trends of the weld pool surface, providing the needed information for welders to make a smart decision. The proposed scheme is feasible for measuring and analyzing the welder's skills and experience.},
